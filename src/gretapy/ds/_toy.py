    """
    Generate synthetic MuData and GRN for testing and demonstration.

    Creates biologically structured test data with RNA and ATAC modalities,
    along with a gene regulatory network (GRN) DataFrame. CREs are placed
    within +/- 100kb of target gene TSS for biological realism. Some genes
    (e.g., IRF4, RUNX1) act as "hub" genes regulated by 4+ TFs across celltypes.

    Additionally, promoter CREs (500bp) are generated for each gene based on
    TSS positions from the hg38 genome annotation. These are placed within
    +1000 upstream to -500 downstream of the TSS and included in the ATAC data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_cells : int
        Number of cells to generate. Should be divisible by number of celltypes
        for equal distribution. Default is 60.
    n_tfs : int
        Number of transcription factors. Must be between 1 and 6. TFs are paired
        by celltype (PAX5/EBF1 for B cells, GATA3/TCF7 for T cells, SPI1/CEBPA
        for monocytes). TFs of the same celltype can co-bind to shared CREs,
        while also having their own unique CREs. Default is 3.
    n_targets_per_tf : int
        Number of target genes per TF. Must be between 1 and 5. Default is 5.
    n_peaks_per_target : int
        Number of CREs (peaks) per target gene. Each CRE is placed within
        +/- 100kb of the gene's TSS. Default is 1.
    celltypes : list[str] | None
        Custom celltype names. If None, uses default celltypes based on n_tfs:
        ["B cell", "T cell", "Monocyte"]. Default is None.
    seed : int
        Random seed for reproducibility. Default is 42.
    verbose : bool
        Whether to log progress messages. Default is False.
    max_expr : float
        Maximum value for expression/accessibility values. Values are scaled
        to resemble log-normalized counts (0 to max_expr). Default is 12.0.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple[mu.MuData, pd.DataFrame]
